> **Background:**
> Mark and Lisa, a couple in their early 40s, experienced a sudden crisis when Mark developed a chronic illness that left him unable to work. The mounting medical bills, combined with the loss of income, led to housing instability. Lisa, now a full-time caregiver, struggled to find work while supporting her husband. Facing homelessness and overwhelming financial strain, they turned to **AmeriTechies** for help.
