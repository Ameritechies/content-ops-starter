**Background:**
Sarah, a 35-year-old mother of two, had struggled with substance use disorder for several years. After completing a rehabilitation program, she found herself sober but without stable housing, making it difficult to rebuild her life and maintain her recovery. Fearful of relapse, Sarah reached out to **\[Your Service Name]** for help.

**Challenges:**

*   Recovery from substance use disorder

*   Lack of safe, sober housing

*   Financial difficulties and childcare responsibilities

**Solution:**
Sarah joined our **Housing Support Program**, designed to support individuals in early recovery from substance use disorders. We provided her with safe, stable housing in a community-living environment. She was also connected to peer support groups, regular therapy sessions, and job training services. Additionally, our team helped Sarah access childcare services so she could focus on her recovery and employment.

**Results:**
Sarah now works part-time in an office role and attends peer support meetings regularly to stay connected to her recovery community. Her children are thriving in school, and Sarah has regained her confidence as both a mother and a professional.

*"After years of addiction, I finally feel like I’m living a life I’m proud of. **AmeriTechies** gave me a safe place to start again and the support I needed to stay clean."*

*Name has been changed to keep patient confidential.*
